# JavaScript Interactive Quiz

For this project, I have created an [interactive quiz](https://mattglwilliams.github.io/interactive-quiz/) using JavaScript. Below, you can see a series of screenshots showcasing the functionality of the website.

When a user lands on the website, below is what is displayed. There is a container with a header and a paragraph introducing the quiz and stating the rules. On the top left is a link to the highscores and on the top right is a timer that will start when the game starts.

When a user clicks the start quiz button, the timer starts and they are given the first question with a series of choices. The choices are clickable and will take them to the next question.

When the user selects an answer, they will be given the next question and also told if their choice was correct or incorrect.

Once they have answered all of the questions or the time is up, they are alerted of that and asked to enter their initials to store their highscore.

Once they enter their initials and click the save your score button, they are taken to the highscore page, where all of the highscores are shown. They can clear all of the scores or go back to the quiz.
